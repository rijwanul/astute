Astute is a website that will help students to solve there psychological problems they might be facing due to remote education with the help of an AI counselor. Apart from that, it is providing them the education related stuffs along with some fun activity that they might have if they feel bored or want some time to invest into activities other than studies. And the best part of the App is that students can set timer for playing the game and after the time is up, they will get a reminder so that they can get back to work or study.

(This project is made for RapidHacks Hackathon organized by OpenWeaver & enactus india)
